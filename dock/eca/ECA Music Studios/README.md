ECA Labs Default Dock Profile
=============================

Pro Tools, Logic, Reaper and Max 7 to the dock along with links to OneDrive, Office365 Email and our support pages.

Jamf Pro doesn't support all the profile keys necessary to get this to work when installed from the JSS, so we deliver the profile via a package.


Build
=====

To build an installer package which will install the profile:

`sh ./build.sh`

That's it. Thanks to Tim Sutton for the build script.
